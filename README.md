## Projects
Here are some of my projects related to computational chemistry and cheminformatics:

### Computational Chemistry

#### [Computational Mechanistic Study of S<sub>N</sub>2 Reaction](https://github.com/chp117/Projects/Molecular_Property_Prediction)
A quantum chemical study of the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction mechanism.  
Includes **transition state (TS) search**, **IRC calculations**, and **energy profile analysis** using Psi4.

#### [Computational Analysis of Diels-Alder Reaction](https://github.com/chp117/Projects/Diels_Alder)
Explores reactivity and orbital interactions in Dielsâ€“Alder reactions through quantum chemistry.  
Focuses on **FMO analysis**, **substituent effects**, **PES scans**, and **3D orbital visualization** using Psi4.

### Cheminformatics

#### [Molecular Property Prediction](https://github.com/chp117/Projects/Molecular_Property_Prediction)
Develops a prediction model for **aqueous solubility (LogS)** of drug-like molecules using **Machine Learning** (MLR and Random Forest).  
Features **data wrangling**, **Mordred molecular descriptors**, **model evaluation**, and **feature importance**.

#### [Chemical Equation Balancer](https://github.com/chp117/Projects/Equation-Balancer)
A Python script for balancing chemical equations from diverse input formats including molecular/condensed formulas of organic molecules and formulas with brackets for inorganic compounds.
